## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
Science and Application. My fascination with technology runs deep, and I'm always on the lookout for the latest in computers and coding. When I'm not immersed in data or algorithms, you can find me indulging in my love for gamingâ€”both on PC and mobile platforms. Beyond the digital realm, I enjoy staying active with swimming and badminton, hobbies that keep me energized and focused. I'm excited to connect with like-minded enthusiasts and explore the endless possibilities in the world of tech and gaming!
